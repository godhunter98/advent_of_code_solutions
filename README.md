# Advent of Code – Python Solutions

This repository houses a long-term effort to chip away at every Advent of Code puzzle. Each year lives in its own directory, the puzzles are solved in standalone Python scripts, and a small helper keeps the boilerplate for downloading personalized inputs tidy.

```

Future years (2015–2021, 2023+) should follow the naming convention `YEAR/Day_<n>_<puzzle_name>.py` so they stay easy to navigate.

## Requirements & Setup

- Python 3.12+
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or `pip`
- [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/) and [`python-dotenv`](https://saurabh-kumar.com/python-dotenv/) are installed automatically through `pyproject.toml`

Install dependencies with either:

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv sync

# or using pip
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

### Configure your Advent of Code session

1. Grab your personal `session` cookie from an authenticated adventofcode.com request.
2. Create a `.env` in the project root (kept out of git) and store the cookie:

   ```env
   session_cookie="<paste the cookie value here>"
   ```

`2022/get_input.py` loads this file via `python-dotenv`, so no further configuration is required once the file exists.

## Running Solutions

Every puzzle script can be executed directly from the repo root:

```bash
python 2022/Day_1_Calorie_Counting.py
python 2022/Day_6_Tuning_Trouble.py
```

Each script imports `fetch_input` from `2022/get_input.py`, which downloads the correct input for the requested year/day using the cookie configured in `.env`. If you want to experiment with custom data, flip the `testing_case` flag (see `Day_6_Tuning_Trouble.py`) or replace the downloaded text with your own string before running the solver logic.

## Input Handling

`fetch_input(year, day)` performs bounds checks, loads `session_cookie` from `.env`, and calls the Advent of Code input endpoint. The helper raises if:

- The day is not between 1–25 or the year is prior to 2015.
- The network request fails (for example, because the cookie expired).

Reusing the helper keeps secrets out of source files and avoids duplicating authentication code. Prefer adding additional helpers (parsing, caching, etc.) next to `get_input.py` so they can be shared across all years.

## Adding New Solutions

1. Create (or reuse) a yearly directory such as `2015/`.
2. Add your puzzle script using `Day_<n>_<descriptive_name>.py`.
3. Import `fetch_input` (or any other shared helpers you add) instead of duplicating download logic.
4. Update `pyproject.toml` if new dependencies are needed and re-run `uv lock` to refresh `uv.lock`.

Document tricky algorithms inline so that future you remembers how everything works.

## Roadmap

- Backfill historical years (2015–2024) with clean, well-tested solutions.
- Expand `2022/get_input.py` into a lightweight CLI for downloading inputs, caching them locally, and running benchmarks.
- Add automated checks (formatting, linting, smoke tests) so each new solution stays reliable.

Happy puzzling, and see you each December!
